a class project where a fellow classmate and i had to create a system that tracked the ip address of various devices
Our team has embarked on a project to develop a Packet ADT that monitors and tracks packets transmitted over a network. 
This ADT includes information about the packet's source, destination, and packet details. Our ultimate goal is to detect malicious packets that may harm the network. 
To accomplish this, we have identified four metrics to determine whether a packet is suspicious or not. 
We will use the Score ADT to calculate the score for each packet and sort them accordingly. 
Suspicious packets with a suspicion score of greater than 5.00 will be added to the stack, while regular packets will be added to the queue. 
The function will then return a sorted queue of all packets with their respective scores in descending order of the overall sequence number.
